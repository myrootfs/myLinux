config OMPING
       bool "omping - Open Multicast Ping"
       help
	 The omping tool is a pure UDP client and server wrapped in a small
	 binary.  Perfectly suited for verifying multicast connectivity on
	 your local network.
	 
	 Compared to traditional ping omping does not use ICMP.  Based on
	 RFC draft <http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-mboned-ssmping-08>
	 and can thus test many different aspects of a setup:
	 
	   "In addition to checking reception of multicast (SSM or ASM),
	    the protocol can provide related information such as multicast
	    tree setup time, the number of hops the packets have traveled,
	    as well as packet delay and loss."
	 
	 Features:
	 
	 - Similar user experience as classic ping tool
	 - Ping multiple hosts at once
	 - Any-source and Source-specific Multicast

	 may want to try MCAST_TEST_NET from RFC5771, 233.252.0.0/24, or
	 the ompoing(8) test group 232.43.211.234 and UDP port 4321.  At

config BUSYBOX
       bool "BusyBox - Your basic embedded swiss army chainsaw"
       help
         BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities
         into a single small executable. It provides replacements for
         most of the utilities you usually find in GNU fileutils,
         shellutils, etc. The utilities in BusyBox generally have fewer
         options than their full-featured GNU cousins; however, the
         options that are included provide the expected functionality
         and behave very much like their GNU counterparts. BusyBox
         provides a fairly complete environment for any small or
         embedded system.
	 
	 BusyBox has been written with size-optimization and limited
	 resources in mind. It is also extremely modular so you can
	 easily include or exclude commands (or features) at compile
	 time. This makes it easy to customize your embedded systems. To
	 create a working system, just add some device nodes in /dev, a
	 few configuration files in /etc, and a Linux kernel.
	 
	 Use `make packages/busybox-menuconfig` and `-saveconfig` to
	 modify and save your BusyBox configuration in TroglOS.

config MG
       bool "mg - A Micro Emacs clone similar to GNU Emacs"
       help
	  Mg is a public domain Micro Emacs derivative.  Created in 1986
	  based on the original MicroEMACS released by Dave Conroy in
	  1985 to comp.sources.unix.
	  
	  The intention is to be a small, fast, and portable Emacs-like
	  editor for users who cannot, or do not want to, run the real
	  Emacs for one reason or another.  Compatibility with GNU Emacs
	  is key for Mg, separating it from other ErsatzEmacs clones,
	  because there should never be any reason to learn more than
	  one Emacs flavor.
