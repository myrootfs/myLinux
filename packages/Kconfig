       help
	 The omping tool is a pure UDP client and server wrapped in a small

	 Compared to traditional ping omping does not use ICMP.  Based on
	 RFC draft <http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-mboned-ssmping-08>
	 and can thus test many different aspects of a setup:
	 
	   "In addition to checking reception of multicast (SSM or ASM),
	    the protocol can provide related information such as multicast
	    tree setup time, the number of hops the packets have traveled,
	    as well as packet delay and loss."
	 
	 Features:
	 
	 - Similar user experience as classic ping tool
	 - Ping multiple hosts at once
	 - Any-source and Source-specific Multicast

config BUSYBOX
       bool "BusyBox - Your basic embedded swiss army chainsaw"
       help
         BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities
         into a single small executable. It provides replacements for
         most of the utilities you usually find in GNU fileutils,
         shellutils, etc. The utilities in BusyBox generally have fewer
         options than their full-featured GNU cousins; however, the
         options that are included provide the expected functionality
         and behave very much like their GNU counterparts. BusyBox
         provides a fairly complete environment for any small or
         embedded system.
	 
	 BusyBox has been written with size-optimization and limited
	 resources in mind. It is also extremely modular so you can
	 easily include or exclude commands (or features) at compile
	 time. This makes it easy to customize your embedded systems. To
	 create a working system, just add some device nodes in /dev, a
	 few configuration files in /etc, and a Linux kernel.
	 
	 Use `make packages/busybox-menuconfig` and `-saveconfig` to
	 modify and save your BusyBox configuration in TroglOS.

	  editor for users who cannot, or do not want to, run the real
	  Emacs for one reason or another.  Compatibility with GNU Emacs
	  is key for Mg, separating it from other ErsatzEmacs clones,
