config BUSYBOX
       bool "BusyBox - Your basic embedded swiss army chainsaw"
       help
         BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities
         into a single small executable. It provides replacements for
         most of the utilities you usually find in GNU fileutils,
         shellutils, etc. The utilities in BusyBox generally have fewer
         options than their full-featured GNU cousins; however, the
         options that are included provide the expected functionality
         and behave very much like their GNU counterparts. BusyBox
         provides a fairly complete environment for any small or
         embedded system.
	 
	 BusyBox has been written with size-optimization and limited
	 resources in mind. It is also extremely modular so you can
	 easily include or exclude commands (or features) at compile
	 time. This makes it easy to customize your embedded systems. To
	 create a working system, just add some device nodes in /dev, a
	 few configuration files in /etc, and a Linux kernel.
	 
	 Use `make packages/busybox-menuconfig` and `-saveconfig` to
	 modify and save your BusyBox configuration.
